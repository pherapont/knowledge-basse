rom collections.abc import Mapping, MutableMapping, Sequence, Iterable
or 'from typing import ...' (required in Python 3.8)

Use Iterable for generic iterables (anything usable in "for"),
and Sequence where a sequence (supporting "len" and "__getitem__") is
required

def f(ints: Iterable[int]) -> list[str]:
    return [str(x) for x in ints]
